# Blackout

Are all those light Hugo themes out there burning your eyes? Well, Blackout may be the solution for your problem!

This theme was created with a focus on minimalism, both in terms of code and visual appearance. No 2000-line CSS files here!

Never heard of Hugo? It is the best thing since sliced bread! Check it out at [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/)!

Screenshots will be added once this theme is in a usable state.

July 2019 Update: I'm officially back to work on this project again!
